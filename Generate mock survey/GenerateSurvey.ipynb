    "Conditions: Questions about relevant factors that impact responders behaviour. The Institutional Analyst can follow aim questions up with condition questions asking whether particular factors influenced their behaviour. E.g. “Did you perform this action due to this factor?” or “Would you perform this action if this factor applied?”. Questions can also be open and ask the responder to identify which factors influenced their behaviour regarding this aim. The more tangible the factor is the more interesting e.g. receiving a subsidy for it, their neighbour did it,  their wage is above a threshold, they saw an advertisement for it, etc. \n",

    "Deontic: Each aim question could be paired with a deontic follow-up question such as: “Do you feel obligated to perform this action” (must), “Do your peers expect you to perform this action” (must), “Are you not allowed to perform this action?” (may not), or “Why did you not perform this action?” (may not/must not). These questions identify the social aspect of the actions.  \n",
