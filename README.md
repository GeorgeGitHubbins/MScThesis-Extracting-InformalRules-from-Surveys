## Project Title: Survey Questionnaire Analysis for Climate Adaptation Behavior

### Introduction
Climate resilience has become a pressing global concern, necessitating informed policymaking and community adaptation strategies. Understanding climate adaptation behavior is crucial for mitigating the impacts of climate change and fostering resilience. However, extracting social structures from survey questionnaire data remains a challenge, lacking standardized methodologies.

### Objective
This project aims to develop a standard method to identify social structures embedded within survey questionnaire data using data analytics and Institutional Grammar (IG). By analyzing responses from a longitudinal survey on climate change adaptation behavior, the objective is to provide a comprehensive overview of norms and shared strategies present in the data.

### Methodology
The project involves the following steps:

1. **Literature Review**: Reviewing existing literature on climate adaptation behavior and IG concepts.
2. **Dataset Exploration**: Exploring a longitudinal survey dataset on climate change adaptation behavior.
3. **Data Analysis Strategies**: Evaluating different data analysis strategies to extract social structures.
4. **Method Development**: Developing a method that aligns IG concepts with survey questions and responses.
5. **Validation and Testing**: Applying the developed method to the survey dataset to validate its effectiveness.

### Research Questions
The main research question guiding this project is:
- What standard method can be developed to extract informal rules-in-use for institutional analysis from survey data?

Sub-questions include:
1. What challenges do researchers face when analyzing socio-technical systems such as climate change adaptation to floods?
2. To what extent does Institutional Grammar facilitate qualitative and quantitative analysis of socio-technical systems such as climate change adaptation to floods?
3. What is the best approach to aligning Institutional Grammar concepts with survey data?
4. What is the most effective combination of data analysis techniques to extract institutional social structures from the questionnaire dataset?

### Scope
The project's scope encompasses a review of relevant literature, examination of the survey dataset, method development, and analysis of results. The project is structured into the following chapters:
1. **Literature Review**: A comprehensive review of climate adaptation behavior and IG concepts.
2. **Dataset Examination**: Detailed exploration and description of the survey dataset.
3. **Methodology**: Development and explanation of the extraction method.
4. **Results**: Analysis and presentation of findings.
5. **Conclusions**: Summary of the project, implications, and future directions.

### Conclusion
This project seeks to address the gap in standardized methodologies for extracting social structures from survey questionnaire data on climate adaptation behavior. By leveraging IG concepts and data analytics, the aim is to provide actionable insights for policymakers and researchers in climate resilience efforts. The developed method will facilitate a deeper understanding of the norms and shared strategies that underpin community responses to climate change, ultimately supporting more effective and informed policy decisions.
