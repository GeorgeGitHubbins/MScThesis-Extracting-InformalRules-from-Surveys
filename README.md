Project Title: Survey Questionnaire Analysis for Climate Adaptation Behavior
Introduction
Climate resilience has become a pressing concern globally, necessitating informed policymaking and community adaptation strategies. Understanding climate adaptation behavior is crucial for mitigating the impacts of climate change and fostering resilience. However, extracting social structures from survey questionnaire data remains a challenge, lacking standardized methodologies.

Objective
This project aims to develop a method to identify social structures embedded within survey questionnaire data using data analytics and Institutional Grammar (IG). By analyzing responses from a longitudinal survey on climate change adaptation behavior, the objective is to provide a holistic overview of norms and shared strategies present in the data.

Methodology
The project involves:

Reviewing existing literature on climate adaptation behavior and IG concepts.
Exploring a longitudinal survey dataset on climate change adaptation behavior.
Evaluating different data analysis strategies to extract social structures.
Developing a method that aligns IG concepts with survey questions and responses.
Research Questions
The main research question guiding this project is:
"What is the most effective method to extract institutional social structures from questionnaire data?"

Sub-questions include:

What challenges do researchers face when analyzing socio-technical systems such as climate change adaptation to floods?
To what extent does Institutional Grammar facilitate qualitative and quantitative analysis of socio-technical systems such as climate change adaptation to floods?
What is the best approach to finding alignment between Institutional Grammar concepts and survey data?
What is the most effective combination of data analysis techniques to extract institutional social structures from the questionnaire dataset?
Scope
The project's scope encompasses a review of relevant literature, examination of the survey dataset, method development, and analysis of results. Chapters include literature review, dataset examination, methodology, results, and conclusions.

Conclusion
This project seeks to address the gap in standardized methodologies for extracting social structures from survey questionnaire data on climate adaptation behavior. By leveraging IG concepts and data analytics, the aim is to provide actionable insights for policymakers and researchers in climate resilience efforts.
